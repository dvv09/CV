        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        I am Vraj Desai,currently studying in 2nd year at Charotar University,Anand.
        I want to have industrial experience in Web Developement.
        I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last project, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. 
        For example, I taught myself how to use Bootstrap to improve the designing.of our website and look very decent to the users. I soon became the go-to person for any design needs.
        <h2>WHAT IS ETHICS AND VALUES FOR ME?</h2>
        Values and Ethics together lay the foundation for sustainability. While they are sometimes used synchronously, they are different, where values refer to the beliefs for which a person has an enduring preference, ethics are the set of rules that governs the behavior of a person, established by a group or culture. 
        Values refer to the important and enduring beliefs or principles, based on which an individual makes judgments in life. It is at the center of our lives which act as a standard of behavior. They severely affect the emotional state of mind of an individual. They can be personal values, cultural values or corporate values.
        Ethics is the policy of living in the society. It is a way of living which nurtures the order in society. The order in society needs to be established and sustained to ensure the continuity of the humankind from one generation to the next forever.

            <h3>Friendship</h3>
            <p>A true friend supports and encourages us, tolerates our shortcomings, accepts us unconditionally, and cares for us no matter what. A real friend walks in, even when they'd rather be somewhere else, when everyone else is walking out. With a true friend the walls come down and you can be who you are without fear.</p>
